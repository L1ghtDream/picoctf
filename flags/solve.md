What do the flags mean?
```

We can see int the given files some country's flags and I suspect the fact that the initial of each country beeing part of out flag.

But there was not. But we know the fact that the flag starts with **picoCTF**

so we got **picoCTF{FXXXXXXXXTXFF**

After a littble bit of research we can find this **https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags**

and here is the flag **PICOCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}**
