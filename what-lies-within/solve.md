```
There's something in the building. Can you retrieve the flag?
```

If we just look at the image we can not see anything so I tryed oppening it un in **Notepad++** and search for **pico** but no luck
So I tryed opening it with a bits editor like **zSteg** and got the flag **picoCTF{h1d1ng_1n_th3_b1t5}**
